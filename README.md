# Video Game Tracker Website

For my phase 2 project, I created a video game tracker website where you can track video games you currently play, add video games by genre, and search for video games that you might be interested in based off of genre and number of players. 

## Available Functions

Using the website, you can do the following: 

### List Games

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Add Games 

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Toggle Games

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
